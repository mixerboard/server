2) Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, and fill the API keys according to the `.env.template` file
3) Run `npm run dev` to start a development enviorment. See `package.json` for a full list of commands

# Contributing
This project is hoping to grow the number of services it integrates with. If you would like to contribute a new service, it would be very apreciated!
